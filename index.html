                    Abstract: <br />
                    This paper estimates the effect of parent unemployment on their children’s educational outcomes. By matching parents who get laid off to parents in the same set of firms who remain employed, we find a negative impact on high school enrollment and completion for children who experience family layoff when they are age 15. In particular, the effects are concentrated to the layoffs that happen right before the high school application deadline, which suggests that the parent layoff has a negative impact on high school choice. The effects are larger when the family-level information cost of the high school choice is higher, and when the layoff is large.

                    we match families with parent layoffs to control families who are connected to a firm with layoffs. We observe a decrease in likelihood of graduating high school on time (at age 19) for children whose parents get laid off when the child is 14 to 16 years old.

                To estimate selection into layoff, we add families with older children at the time of layoff. A parental layoff at age 21 can not affect high school graduation at age 19.
